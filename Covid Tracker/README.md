Covid Tracker:
This folder contains sample files for a covid-tracking project that myself and a group of data scientists decided to create.
One file contains one of the ETL processes that I created to insert the webscrapped government data into our personal database.
Another file contains a database diagram for the database I created to house the required data for the project.
I was tasked with developing the entire data structure, including the server's DevOps.
In the end we were supposed to create a heatmap per circumscription of the country that would update daily with new data,
as well as predicting the future days ahead. However, due to lack of government support (and the fact that they closed the website
we were webscraping from) the project was suspended, but remains live for portfolio purposes nonetheless.
