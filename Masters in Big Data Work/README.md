Masters in Big Data and Business Analytics
Program at ie University

This repository contains the code for all classes within the program I graduated from in March 2023.

Below is a list of each class and a brief description of the work done in each one.

- Data Visualization: This class was focused on the use of PowerBI to create visualizations of data. The final project consisted of creating a dashboard for the ministry of mobility of Spain regarding a number of infractions over time.
- Deep Learning: This class was focused on the use of neural networks to solve problems. The final project consisted of creating a model to accurately distinguish human faces in real time using a single image prior for learning. Along this, a number of files with additional intermediate projects are included.
- Graduation Project: In conjunction with KPMG, our group was tasked with creating a model to predict future sales and demand based on past behavior. The final project consisted of a presentation to the client, and a report detailing the process and results of the project.
- Machine Learning: A report of a project we had to build using an online resource named Dataiku to create a model to analyze the variables of impact on the price of rent in Madrid.
- Modern Data Architectures: This class concerned on the use of cloud architectures to ingest, store and deploy data. The final project consisted of creating a storage model to save streamed data from Binance's API to store and use later.
- Natural Language Processing: This class made use of NLP to solve problems. The final project consisted of fine-tuning a question/answer model to answer questions about legal documents.
- Python for Data Science: This class was focused on the use of Python in a Data Science setting. The final project consisted of using Pythonic skills to infer information about a dataset and extract conclusions. An additional project was also included.
- SARIMA Modeling: In this class we utilized SARIMA models to predict time series. The final project consisted of creating a model to predict the number of passengers in a given airport.
- SQL Architectures: This class was focused on the use of SQL to create databases and extract information from them. The final project consisted of creating a database to store information about the solar system and extract information from it.
